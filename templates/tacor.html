        <h3> Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 4 fresh jalapeno peppers </li>
            <li>1 small red onion chopped.</li>
            <li>4-5 garlic cloves</li>
            <li> 1/2 cup Neutral oil ,avocado oil, or a  vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Receipe Details </h3>
        <ol>
        <li> Slice the stems from the <strong>jalapeno peppers</strong> and add them to a medium sized pot along with the onion. </li>
        <li>  Cover with water and bring to a quick boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the jalapeno peppers soften up 
                but do not let them become mushy.</li>
        <li> Strain but keep the liquid on hand.</li>
        <li> Add the boiled jalapeno and onion to a food processor along with the garlic, oil and salt. Process until very smooth and creamy, about 4-5 minutes.</li>
        <li> If youâ€™d like a thinner sauce, add in a few tablespoons of the reserved boiling water. Adjust for salt and serve!</li>
